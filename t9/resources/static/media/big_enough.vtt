00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:25.500
I've lived in lonely cities 

2
00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:29.060
I've crossed deserts on camel back 

3
00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:33.500
And I've filled the halls of folklore 

4
00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:36.900
With things I'd rather we forget 

5
00:00:37.475 --> 00:00:43.740
I could sweep you off the street so saying this is goddamn tough 

6
00:00:44.075 --> 00:00:48.640
But this town might be big enough

7
00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:53.660
See, I reckon what you're saying

8
00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:57.150
But this dog's run every course

9
00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:01.350
I roam without my boots on 

10
00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:04.790
I raced without my horse

11
00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:12.633
And then I ate my horse's meat straight from my horse's bones

12
00:01:13.275 --> 00:01:14.785
'Cause this dog

13
00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:19.680
Must roam alone

14
00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:41.025
You could shoot me in the mountains

15
00:01:41.025 --> 00:01:44.110
In the cold fat rain

16
00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:47.675
We could do it in the countryside

17
00:01:47.675 --> 00:01:49.000
As we 

18
00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.250
walk the plain

19
00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:55.160
It wouldn't give us any closure

20
00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:58.425
All cowboys need to trust

21
00:01:58.425 --> 00:02:03.320
That this town might be big enough

22
00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:07.880
For both of us

23
00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:26.130
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA

24
00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:30.100
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA

25
00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:34.220
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA

26
00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:37.780
AAAAAYIYAAAAYIYAAAAA

27
00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:41.050
RRAAAAA

28
00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:42.710
HOOOO

29
00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:46.375
OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO

30
00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:49.070
OOOOOOOOO

31
00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:53.700
OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO

32
00:02:56.625 --> 00:03:00.160
Well, I'd be a doggamn liar 

33
00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:03.600
If I said this ain't a lonely 

34
00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:04.490
town

35
00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:09.075
And what I wouldn't give

36
00:03:09.075 --> 00:03:11.690
To have a friend around 

37
00:03:12.025 --> 00:03:16.466
We could trade in all our silver bullets 

38
00:03:16.466 --> 00:03:19.385
And buy a patch of dust 

39
00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:23.400
This town might just be big enough

40
00:03:28.475 --> 00:03:30.605
For all of us 

41
00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:38.725
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA

42
00:03:38.725 --> 00:03:40.050

43
00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:42.050

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:43.350
This world!

45
00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:44.375
Are you

46
00:03:44.375 --> 00:03:45.570
Big enough?

47
00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:50.120
From Australia

48
00:03:51.325 --> 00:03:53.500

52
00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:01.210
Let me out

53

In Syria

61
00:04:12.099 --> 00:04:13.125

63
00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:15.825
We're gonna be big enough

00:04:15.825 --> 00:04:17.650
